# parcelsort

At a very early stage. Kind of like spike sorting, but intentionally overclustering. Intended for exploratory research during method development.

## Prerequisites

Install and set up kachery and sortingview

## Installation

Clone this repo.

Install parcelsort in the same conda environment as kachery and sortingview:

```bash
cd parcelsort
pip install -e .
```

## Running the example

See `devel/example1.py`

Adapt this script. After running you will get a URI to the parcel sorting as well as a figURL for visualization.

Here is an example output:
